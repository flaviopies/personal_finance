# Personal Finance

Personal_finance is a personal project to data-mine credit cards expenses and report them in a more profund way that bank does. 

To do so, the project leverages another app called Guia Bolso, for Brazilian banks, that already does the job of bringing together information from different sources.

So far, the code will mine the data and report it by e-mail in four charts:
* Monthly expenses (barchart)
* Weekly expenses (barchart)
* Expenses by week and weekday (heatmap)
* Expenses by category
